            <h2>Controls</h2>
            Press the button that says "paused" to start the simulation! The grid cannot be edited while the simulation is running.
            <ul>
                <li>Press spacebar to toggle whether simulation is running or paused
                <li>Press the right arrow key to advance the simulation one step while paused
                <li>Press the up arrow key to make the simulation slower
                <li>Press the down arrow key to make the simulation faster
                <li>Left click to toggle a cell on or off
                <li>Left click and drag to draw a line of cells
                <li>Middle click on the canvas to pan around
                <li>Right click and drag to select a portion of the grid to copy
                <li>Left click with the copy to place it on the grid
                <li>Right click once to empty the clipboard
            </ul>

            <p>On the left of the game window, there is a list of buttons. Click one to copy a schematic to your clipboard! üìã

            <p>The canvas is infinite, at least until your computer runs out of memory or crashes üôÇ. If the game runs out of
            memory, it will pause the game.

            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>This is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.
            It's a zero player game, where you set up some initial conditions, press play, and then sit back and watch what happens.
            <p>In Conway's Game of Life, there is a grid that cells live on. A cell lives and dies by the following rules:
            <ul>
                <li>If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, they keep on living üôÇ
                <li>If a spot on the grid is empty and has 3 neighbors, a new cell is created üê£
                <li>If a cell has 1 or 0 neighbors, they die of loneliness ‚ö∞Ô∏è
                <li>If a cell has more than 3 neighbors, they die of overcrowding ‚ö∞Ô∏è
            </ul>
