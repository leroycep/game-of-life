            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>This is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.
            It's a zero player game, where you set up some initial conditions, press play, and then sit back and watch what happens.
            <p>In Conway's Game of Life, there is a grid that cells live on. A cell lives and dies by the following rules:
            <ul>
                <li>If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, they keep on living üôÇ
                <li>If a spot on the grid is empty and has 3 neighbors, a new cell is created üê£
                <li>If a cell has 1 or 0 neighbors, they die of loneliness ‚ö∞Ô∏è
                <li>If a cell has more than 3 neighbors, they die of overcrowding ‚ö∞Ô∏è
            </ul>
